Discuss Executive Information systems (EISs) and how they work. Use an example of either a business such as Walmart, Target or a company in a different business sector.  How would this business understand the value and benefits of EIS?  You may want to read up on the possible failures of designing EISs in the textbook to gain some insight into why these failures occurred. Your response should be no less than two paragraphs in length.



Executive Information Systems (EIS) are those systems that are used by higher level management in business to have access to real time data across the organization. For example, if it is important to track the trends related to the sales of a specific product, management can use the EIS to view and analyze the relevant information and make appropriate informed decisions. 

There are a variety of benefits to using EIS systems. In the case of Walmart, for example, those in charge of the EIS can identify which stores are in need of specific goods and they can redirect shipping/ transportation to make sure the needed items get to the specified location. EIS can be used in the inverse; when an item or product is recalled, the management can use the systems to track which stores are impacted and generate reports that will help with the recall process.
