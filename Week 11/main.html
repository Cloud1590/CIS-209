In our readings for this week, we discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and automation.  AI and automation rely on semi-structured and structured operational data.  Because of this it is important to know how to structure and model data.  For your homework this week you get the opportunity to transform a data set of operational data into a structured data model.
The Student Excel workbook Click for more options contains the operational data for students in the College of Computing. Your homework for this week is to transform this table into Second Normal Form (2NF).
Here is what you will need to submit for your homework.
The Student Excel workbook with a new sheet called 'Second Normal Form'.
The new sheet will contain the operational data but transformed into 2NF with the appropriate primary key identified and two different tables - students and courses.
