Cloud computing, specifically backup and recovery software, provides an easy and secure way for businesses to keep their data safe and out of their physical business while still having full access to their data. When evaluating which cloud service is best suited for a business, cost is a factor. For some businesses, especially small businesses, it can be more cost effective to securely store their data in the cloud. Self- hosting servers can be an expensive option, especially in the short term. There is hardware to purchase, software to configure, and staff required to make sure everything runs well.  

Google Drive is one of the most popular examples of cloud computing. With Google Drive, you can share files with others, and can give them access to view, edit or comment. It is helpful to see what has changed within the file, who made the changes and when the changes were made. Google Drive has advanced search features which makes it easy to search by file type, who owns the file, file type, where it is stored, and when it was last accessed. Google Drive is frequently used by school systems because of the consistency of features and user options for a variety of users.

I attended a school district that utilized Google Drive. After the initial learning curve, I found that Google Drive- and the affiliated suite of apps- was easy to access and use across a variety of classroom environments. While it is an efficient and consistent way to store and access a variety of files, I found that beyond high school, this has not been my primary option for cloud storage. As a technology minded individual, I have made the decision to host my own storage server. I am able to access my files from anywhere and it is private and secure; nobody else can access it. For the vast majority of the population, an application like Google Drive would be sufficient for their storage needs.
