One of the topics we study in our readings for this week is programming languages.  
Our text book discusses the use of HTML, JavaScript and CSS in Web Programming.  

For your discussion post this week you get a chance to code and learn about HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
Watch the following video on the introduction to HTML, CSS, and Javascript: Introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bellevue, 2023). 
This video has several suggestions on how to complete your HTML code for this week. It is highly suggested that you watch this video before you start building your HTML.


After you watch the video, create an HTML page that includes the following tags:

• An H3 tag that has a style attribute with an orange background.

• A paragraph or two that explains HTML, CSS and Javascript – what they are and how they are used to create web pages.

• A second H3 tag that has a style attribute with slate blue background.
