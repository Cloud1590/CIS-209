<!-- Paragraph Explaining HTML -->
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
It is used to format content into a webpage, such as text, images, links, forms, tables, etc.
HTML is essential for web developers to learn due to its use in all modern websites.


</p>


<p>HTML is made up of various elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.
These elements are represented by tags, which are used to define the structure and content of the web page.

<!-- JavaScript Code -->
<script>
console.log("Hello World!");
</script>

<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages.
It is used to add styles, colors, font sizes, and more to HTML elements.

While it is possible to use HTML without CSS, developers learning HTML should also learn CSS to create a more visually appealing website.
