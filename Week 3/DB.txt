One of the topics we study in our readings for this week is the relational model. 
Our text book discusses the importance of primary keys in supporting the relational model. 
For your discussion form this week you get a chance to code and learn about primary keys using HTML.
Create an HTML page with an HTML table. Here is an example of the HTML table you will be creating:

This table is not in first normal form because it lacks a primary key. 
Modify the HTML table, color one or more TH elements, with the STYLE attribute identifying the appropriate primary key.
