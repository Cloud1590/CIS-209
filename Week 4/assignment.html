What are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are sent by web servers to the user’s web browser. These cookies are stored as plain text files on the user’s device. Users have the option to accept all cookies or to specify only those cookies that they are willing to accept. Most can be toggled on and off, but some are required to make sure a website functions properly.

What are the functions of cookies? There are two main types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.  Session cookies are active only while the web browser is open. An example of a session cookie is keeping you logged in to a website (i.e. Amazon) while you browse the website.  Persistent cookies on the other hand stay on the device even after you close the web browser.  Persistent cookies may include website preferences or login details, and they are stored on the computer until deleted by automatic processes or by users. 

How can cookies be a privacy risk? People like to think that whatever is on their computer is private. However, some cookies that have been “accepted” by the user can actually track online searches and be used to send targeted ads to your computer as you are online. Some people believe this is a breach of privacy because they didn’t ask to be tracked.

What is a super cookie and how is it different from a regular cookie? A super cookie is a more persistent cookie, which is often used without user permission or awareness. Super cookies are hard to locate and delete because they are stored differently. Super cookies can be more of a privacy problem because users are usually unaware that the super cookies are stored on the device. Using private browsing does not prevent super cookies because these cookies are not stored in the browser itself. 

How does a cookie work?  When a user goes to a website, the browser will send a request to the server for access to the website.  The server responds to the request and also sends the small text files (cookies) to be stored on the user’s computer. The cookies are stored in a designated place on the device. Then, when the user later revisits the same website, the saved cookies can help the server to remember the user. For example, when you go to the Amazon website, the server can “remember” what you were previously looking for- by using cookies- and can offer you suggestions to fulfill your search requests.
