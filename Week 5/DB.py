# Answer:

Securing your data is on of the most important things you can do to protect yourself from cyber attacks. Nobody likes losing their data, and it can be a real pain to recover it. 
There are many types of attacks that can happen to you at home, but two main examples are phishing and malware attacks.
	According to Cloudflare, “Phishing refers to an attempt to steal sensitive information, typically in the form of usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account information or other important data in order to utilize or sell the stolen information.” The user targeted will receive an email claiming to be a company that the user would recognize- usually with some kind of “Urgent” information. The user likely doesn’t realize that the email contained code to capture some sensitive information from the computer. 
Just like emails can be malicious, software can be too. Installing software from unknown sources is even more dangerous than emails, because the software may contain malware. Since the software has full access to your computer, so does the malware. In some of the worst cases, the attacker can completely control your computer- and all of your data. In some cases, phishing can lead to the user installing malware, giving the attacker more control.
