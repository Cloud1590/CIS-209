What is the purpose of the following four components within a network?  
Protocols
TCP/IP
Routing
Routers

Protocols: Protocols are a set of rules that computers use to communicate between devices on a network. They define how data is transmitted, received, and processed, ensuring that devices can communicate effectively with each other.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is an industry-standard suite of communication protocols that enables interoperability between devices on different platforms. It provides the foundation for internet communication by linking devices across networks. Together, TCP and IP ensure efficient and reliable data communication over the internet.

Routing is the process of determining the most efficient path for data to travel from one network to another. It involves analyzing network conditions and forwarding data packets to their destination based on the network type and routing software. These components and methods work together to ensure data is efficiently and reliably transmitted across networks.

Routers are network connection devices equipped with software that connects different networks and manages the flow of data between them. Operating at the OSI modelâ€™s Network layer, routers play a vital role in directing network traffic efficiently. Routers ensure effective communication between devices across networks by efficiently managing data flow and preventing traffic issues.
