What is the purpose of the following four components within a network?  
Protocols
TCP/IP
Routing
Routers

Protocols: Protocols are a set of rules that govern the communication between devices on a network. They define how data is transmitted, received, and processed, ensuring that devices can communicate effectively with each other.

TCP/IP: TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of protocols that governs how data is transmitted over the internet. It is the foundation of the internet and allows devices to communicate with each other across networks.

Routing: Routing is the process of determining the best path for data to travel from one network to another. It involves analyzing network traffic, determining the most efficient route, and forwarding data packets to their destination.

Routers: Routers are devices that connect different networks together and facilitate the routing of data between them. They use routing tables to determine the best path for data to travel and ensure that it reaches its destination efficiently. Routers play a crucial role in directing data traffic on a network and ensuring that devices can communicate with each other effectively.
