Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

HTML is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. 
It uses various elements such as tags and attributes to define headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other content. 
This forms the backbone of most websites.

Domain Name System (DNS)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical system used to translate human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the internet. It acts as a directory, enabling browsers to locate and access websites quickly by mapping domain names to specific servers.

Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the address used to access resources on the internet such as websites, images, or files. A URL specifies the protocol (e.g., http or https), domain, and the exact location of the resource, allowing users and browsers to retrieve and display web content. Full example: http://localhost/main.html

Value Chain

A value chain refers to the series of activities that an organization performs to create and deliver a product or service to the market. The value chain can help identify areas where companies can optimize processes and enhance value- overall improving their competitive advantage.

Web Marketing

Web marketing- also known as online marketing, involves using digital means such as search engines, social media, and email to promote products or services. It leverages various strategies including search engine optimization (SEO), content marketing, and pay-per-click advertising, to drive traffic and increase conversions.

HTML Meta Tag

The HTML meta tag provides metadata about a web page that isn’t directly visible to the user but is essential for search engines and browsers. Meta tags are used to describe the page’s content such as keywords, description, and author. They can also specify the character set and other parameters that help improve a site’s SEO.

HTML Head Tag

The <head> tag in HTML contains metadata and links to external resources like stylesheets, scripts, and fonts, which are necessary for the webpage’s functionality and appearance. While the content inside the <head> tag is not visible on the page, it plays a critical role in defining the page’s UI, settings, and performance.

HTML Title Tag

The <title> tag in HTML defines the title of a webpage, which appears in the browser’s tab, and is used by search engines to index the page. A well made title tag can improve a webpage’s search engine rankings by clearly describing its content and making it more relevant to user queries.
