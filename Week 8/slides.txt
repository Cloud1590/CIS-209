Phase 1: Planning (1 of 2) 
•Systems designer must define the problem the organization faces
•Problem can be identified internally and externally
•Analysts assess needs of the organization or a specific group of users
•Organization’s strategic goals
•How proposed system can support goals
•Factors critical to the system’s success
•Criteria for evaluating performance
•



Phase 1: Planning (2 of 2) 

•Analysts must get feedback from users on the problem
•At the end of the phase, users and top management should have a clear view of the why, who, when, and what of the problem
•


Phase 2: Requirements-Gathering and Analysis 
(1 of 2) 

•Analysts define the problem and generate alternatives for solving it
•Team attempts to understand the requirements for the system
•Analyzes requirements to determine the main problem with the current system or processes
•Looks for ways to solve problems by designing the new system
•
Phase 2: Requirements-Gathering and Analysis 
(2 of 2) 

•Analysis and design approaches 
•Structured systems analysis and design (SSAD)
•Sequential approach that treats process and data independently
•Object-oriented
•Combines process and data analysis
•Models created during the analysis phase constitute design specifications
•
Phase 3: Design (1 of 2) 

•Analysts choose the most realistic solution that offers the highest payoff for the organization 
•Details of the proposed solution are outlined
•Output is a document with exact specifications for implementing the system
•Files and databases
•Forms and reports
•Documentation and procedures
•Hardware and software
•Networking components
•General system specifications
•
•


Phase 3: Design (2 of 2) 

•Design phase consists of three parts
•Conceptual design: overview of the system and does not include hardware or software choices
•Logical design: makes conceptual design specific by indicating hardware and software
•Physical design: created for specific platforms
•
•


Phase 4: Implementation (1 of 2) 

•Team configures the system and procures components for it
•Tasks involved
•Acquiring new equipment
•Hiring and training new employees
•Planning and designing physical layout
•Coding and testing
•Designing security measures and safeguards
•Creating a disaster recovery plan
•
•


Phase 4: Implementation (2 of 2) 

•Conversion options
•Parallel: old and new systems run simultaneously for a short time to ensure the new system works correctly
•Phased-in-phased-out: as each module of the new system is converted, the corresponding part of the old system is retired
•Process continues until the entire system is operational
•Plunge (direct cutover): old system is stopped and the new system is implemented
•Pilot: analyst introduces the system in a limited area of the organization
•Implemented in the rest of the organization in stages or all at once if the system works correctly
•
•
•
•
Phase 5: Maintenance (1 of 2) 

•Information system is operating
•Enhancements and modifications to the system have been developed and tested
•Hardware and software components have been added or replaced
•
•
Phase 5: Maintenance (2 of 2) 

•Performance data and information is gathered and assessed
•Feedback from users, customers, and other people affected by the new system is collected
•Corrective action is taken if the system’s objectives are not being met
•
