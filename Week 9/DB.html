What is EDI? What is XML, and how are they different?

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a standardized method for exchanging business information between organizations in a structured, machine-readable format. It replaces traditional paper-based communication such as purchase orders, invoices, or shipping notices, enabling seamless communication between trading partners. EDI relies on specific standards like ANSI X12, EDIFACT, or TRADACOMS, which ensure compatibility between systems, even if they come from different organizations. By automating the exchange of critical data, EDI improves accuracy, reduces processing time, and lowers operational costs.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language), on the other hand, is a flexible, human-readable markup language used to define and transport data between systems. Unlike EDI, XML is not tied to specific business transactions or industries. Instead, it provides a framework for structuring data in a hierarchical format, making it adaptable for a wide range of applications, from web development to data storage and sharing. XML is extensible, meaning users can define their tags, and it is widely supported across different programming languages and platforms.

The key differences between EDI and XML lie in their purpose and implementation. EDI is a rigid, highly standardized system designed specifically for business-to-business (B2B) transactions, while XML is more flexible and used for general data exchange across various domains. While EDI offers reliability and consistency in its structured format, XMLâ€™s flexibility makes it more suitable for modern web services and APIs. Both technologies play vital roles in facilitating digital communication, with EDI being prominent in industries like retail and manufacturing, and XML widely adopted in web-based applications.
